# INTRODUCTION
   A model of an automated temperature prediction on smart AC system for a room has been designed, developed and implemented
   with an embedded system. In a room, temperature of object (like human being) with the environment is detected, identified and analyzed, with an ideal temperature.
# RESEARCH
  Automation in air condition is exceedingly challenging and demanding now a day. Manually control air condition is found as the problem to serve a lot of people at a time. In the absence of smart AC, it's tough to change the temperature every time, where a large number of people are present such as meeting rooms, hall rooms, buses, airplanes, and so on. Therefore, there must be a role to play in confirming comfort temperature for humans with the help of smart AC. However, researchers are more focusing on automation in AC to avoid the disturbance for manual control.
