# INTRODUCTION
   A model of an automated temperature prediction on smart AC system for a room has been designed, developed and implemented
   with an embedded system. In a room, temperature of any object like human being with the environment is detected, identified and analyzed, with an ideal temperature.
   Proposed embedded system can be implemented in any smart AC room where anyone can utilize the AC system automatically switched on/off with the predicted temperature. 
# RESEARCH
   An air conditioner is a system that is used to cool down a space by removing heat from the space and moving it to some outside area. The cool air can then be moved throughout a
building through ventilation. Air conditioners require some input of work to operatre, otherwise entropy would decrease naturally which is forbidden by the Second law 
of thermodynamics. Air conditioners act similarly to a heat pump, but instead follow a cooling cycle.Automation in air condition is  challenging and demanding now a day. Manually 
control air condition is found as the problem to serve a lot of people at a time. In theabsence of smart AC, it's tough to change the temperature every time, where a large number 
of people are present such as meeting rooms, hall rooms, buses, airplanes, and so on. therefore there must be a role to play in confirming comfort temperature for humans with the 
help of smart AC. However, researchers are more focusing on automation in AC to avoid the disturbance for manual control.The main objective of the project is to provide automation 
in air conditioning.
