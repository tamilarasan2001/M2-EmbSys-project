# INTRODUCTION
Automatic temperature control system is an important application used
in almost all modern gadgets and smart homes. The system for controlling temperature automatically is achieved by using Arduino Uno-based microcontroller
system. Arduino Uno due to its increased popularity finds its varied range of
applications. Temperature sensor LM35 and Arduino Uno are the hardware used
interfaced with computer, and the temperature is controlled in the room.
Temperature is displayed on LCD display employing A1 pin of hardware with the
help of analog pin utilizing pulse width modulation (PWM). We have designed
temperature control as an automatic system that has been not attempted before the
way it has been implemented.
