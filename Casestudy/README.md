# INTRODUCTION
The Sun tracking solar panel consists of two LDRs, solar panel and a servo motor and ATmega328 Micro controller.
Two light dependent resistors are arranged on the edges of the solar panel. Light dependent resistors produce low resistance when light falls on them. The servo motor connected to the panel rotates the panel in the direction of Sun. Panel is arranged in such a way that light on two LDRs is compared and panel is rotated towards LDR which have high intensity i.e. low resistance compared to other. Servo motor rotates the panel at certain angle.When the intensity of the light falling on right LDR is more, panel slowly moves towards right and if intensity on the left LDR is more, panel slowly moves towards left. In the noon time, Sun is ahead and intensity of light on both the panels is same. In such cases, panel is constant and there is no rotation.

# COMPONENTS REQUIRED
* ATmega328 micro controller,
* Solar panel, 
* Light Dependent resistors 
* Servo Motor.

# FEATURES
* These panels can be used to power the traffic lights and streetlights
* These can be used in home to power the appliances using solar power.
* These can be used in industries as more energy can be saved by rotating the panel.
# Limitations of Sun Tracking Solar Panel Circuit
* Though solar energy can be utilized to maximum extent this may create problems in rainy season.
* Although solar energy can be saved to batteries, they are heavy and occupy more space and required to change time to time.
They are expensive.
